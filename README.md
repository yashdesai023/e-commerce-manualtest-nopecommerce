Manual testing is the foundation of high-fidelity Quality Engineering. This project aims to:
1.  **Validate Business Logic**: Ensuring core e-commerce flows (Login, Search, Cart, Checkout) work as expected.
2.  **Ensure UI/UX Integrity**: Verifying visual consistency and user experience across different browsers.
3.  **Document Test Coverage**: Creating a traceable link between requirements and test cases.
4.  **Identify Critical Regressions**: Using structured bug reporting to track and resolve defects.

## 🛠️ Testing Methodology

The testing process followed a strict **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**:

*   **Requirement Analysis**: Identifying testable features from user requirements.
*   **Test Planning**: Defining the scope, resources, and schedule for testing.
*   **Test Case Design**: Writing detailed, step-by-step test cases with expected results.
*   **Execution & Reporting**: Manually executing tests and logging defects with severity and priority.
